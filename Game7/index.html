<h2>Long Way From Home (Part 2)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Most spaceship games are about destroying other ships or enemeies. This game is unique because it is all about survival. There is no fighting back. Just survive until you get back home.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game has many random elements as well as skill based gameplay. This creates a unique challenge every time while still relying on player skill.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest thing about this prototype was the difficulty. You want it to be rewarding without being impossible. It took a lot of testing to get the difficulty just right. <br>
Also I learned how to manipulate hitboxes which is very important in a game like this.
</li>

</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not sure exactly what game it is close to. Most games in space have you destroying things. This one is more about fighting for survival by simply staying alive and making it home.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You have to manuver through a meteorite storm in order to get back home!
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Using keyboard input to control the ship. There is randomness in where the meteorites spawn and how fast they fall. Also their speed increases over time by a random amount.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Understand groups better. When to use them and how they're useful. Also gain more experience with the physics of the game engine. Understanding hitboxes was also a big goal.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Survive the worstening meteorite storm and make it back home.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player controls the ship using the left and right arrow keys. The meteorites travel straight down towards the bottom of the screen. Every meteorite the player dodges increases their distance traveled. They have to reach home which is 10,000 away.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Look ahead at where meteorites are dropping from so you dont trap yourself. Quick reflexes also come in very handy for this game.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You find yourself in the middle of space. You know how to get back home but you're a long ways away. Traverse through a meteorite storm to get back home or else you're doomed.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is great for all ages and levels of experience. Those who like a definitive ending will like this game as apposed to endless games where the goal is a new high score.
</li>

<br>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
No more than a minute or two each playthrough.
