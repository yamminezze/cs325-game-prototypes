<h2>Breakout Unchained!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A breakout game without being stuck of the horizontal axis.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The ball moves faster than most breakout games since you now have the freedom of moving the paddle vertically as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most of the assets are from an expample Phaser game called "Breakout". I changed the background image using a Google image. Source: https://goo.gl/images/aaydBJ

<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The example Phaser game "Breakout" is the game I used to make my version. Much of the code is similar except for what is needed to allow the paddle to move vertically and all the changes that come with that as well as changing the velocity of the ball. Since the difficulty has changed, the point values changed as well.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Destroy all the bricks before running out of lives
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
?
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
It uses mouse click and movement input. It can become a fast paced game at certain points. If the ball hits the paddle directly in the center, there is some randomness to where the ball goes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Ball bouncing physics and user input measurment.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Having the satisfaction of beating the entire level (or multiple levels) and seeing their score at the end
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Click to start and launch the ball. You use the mouse to control where the paddle is. If the ball falls below your paddle, you lose a life. Lose 3 lives and its game over. You get points for each brick you destroy and a big bonus if you destroy them all. Good Luck!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Knowing where to bouce the ball so that it destroys as many bricks as possible before returning to the paddle.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game doesn't have much story. It takes place in space, and you're a paddle destroying bricks. Maybe in the future it could be upgraded.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is great for all ages and levels of experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A couple of minutes. Can be longer if player is highly skilled. --
